# Fake_news_Detection
This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at detecting fake news articles. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to classify news articles as either real or fake. This is an important application in today's digital age to combat misinformation and promote the dissemination of accurate information.

This Project is to solve the problem with fake news. In this we have used two datasets named "Fake" and "True" from Kaggle. You can download the file from here https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset I have used five classifiers in this project the are Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression.
